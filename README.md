Create your own organization cli tool like gcloud or aws-cli. Toolbx helps you with exploration and distribution of your internal CLI tools

## Install Toolbx

Toolbx currently provides binaries for the following:

- MacOS (64bit only)
- Linux 
- Windows

Download appropriate version for your platform from [Toolbx Releases](). Once
it's downloaded, you will unarchive the `toolbx` binary. You don't need to 
install the binary to some global location. The binary works well also from 
any place.

But for easy to use you should move the `toolbx` binary somewhere in your `PATH` 
(e.g. to `/usr/local/bin`).
